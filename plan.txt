Training

    There are 3 varying parameters that will be tested in this project that involve training. These include:
        dt - Amount of memory network has
        transpositionRange - The range at which a sample can be transposed by
        convertToC - If all samples will be converted to C key signature

    8 different models will be trained:

        1. "default"
            dt = 16
            transpositionRange = (-10,10)
            convertToC = False

        2. "more_dt"
            dt = 32
            transpositionRange = (-10,10)
            convertToC = False

        3. "less_dt"
            dt = 8
            transpositionRange = (-10,10)
            convertToC = False

        4. "more_transposition"
            dt = 16
            transpositionRange = (-16,16)
            convertToC = False

        5. "less_transposition"
            dt = 16
            transpositionRange = (-5,5)
            convertToC = False

        6. "convert_to_c"
            dt = 16
            transpositionRange = (0,0)
            convertToC = True

        7. "more_dt_and_transposition"
            dt = 32
            transpositionRange = (-16,16)
            convertToC = False


        8. "less_dt_and_transposition"
            dt = 8
            transpositionRange = (-5,5)
            convertToC = False


    Each model will be trained with 25000 randomly selected samples per epoch until validation loss stops decreasing.
    Validation loss will be calculated using 25000 unseen randomly selected samples. 

Testing

    During training the following metrics will be recorded at a per epoch basis:
        1. Training accuracy
        2. Testing accuracy
        3. Training loss
        4. Testing loss
    
    At the end of training, music will be generated 2 different ways:
        1. Gibbs sampling from randomly intialized piece 
        2. Gibbs sampling from piece


    The music generation actually has a few parameters:
        iterations - The number of full sweeps of the resampling process that will be made. The range of iteration values
            will be [20,30,40]
        temperature - The "randomness" of the resampling. The range of temperature values are going to be [0.7,1,1.2,1.5]

    10 hand selected pieces will be used. Those include:
        TBD
